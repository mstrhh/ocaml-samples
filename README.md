Repository ocaml-samples, alias ocaml examples
=======================

The ocaml software is open source, and the [packages](https://opam.ocaml.org/) are open source,
but it often looks like the code has been run through a comment cleaner.

For those who want to or have to learn [programming in OCaml](http://ocaml.org) I want to
provide some code samples, commented, and starting on a simple level.

Especially if you are coming from an imperative languages and scripting background, where the list data
structure does not play a role, it can be difficult to see how you can build your application
on list data.

- [How to execute](how-to-execute.md) your program
- a [small helper script](gitit.ml), well commented, to commit your changes to git repo
- a try at [timing the hash functions](test_cryptokit.ml) from Cryptokit.Hash
- a little [helper when compiling](watch_and_exec.ml) programs or the like
