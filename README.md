Repository ocaml-samples
=======================

The ocaml software is open source, and the [packages](https://opam.ocaml.org/) are open source,
but it often looks like the code has been run through a comment cleaner.

For those who want to or have to learn [programming in OCaml](http://ocaml.org) I want to
provide some code samples, commented, and starting on a simple level.

Especially for those coming from an imperative languages and scripting background, where the list data
structure does not play a role, it is often difficult to see how you build your application
with it.
